# Damn Vulnerable Blog (DVB)

Damn Vulnerable Blog (DVB) is a Flask-based blog web application intentionally designed to be vulnerable.

It provides common blogging features such as user registration, login, posting, commenting, changing passwords, and file uploads, but all implemented in insecure ways on purpose.

DVB is intentionally vulnerable to give you a hands-on learning experience in security testing. You can safely experiment with its flaws and study the source code to understand how vulnerabilities arise.
